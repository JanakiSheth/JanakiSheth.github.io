**Classification of phonemes using neural recordings**

Advisors: William Speier, Abeer Alwan

Preliminary analysis of multi-electrode LFP signals using machine learning to recognize differentiating neural channels for phoneme classification.

**Analysis of Kramer’s rule in auditory models**

Advisors: Dolores Bozovic, Alex Levine (Manuscript in preperation)

Characterized homogenization of complex auditory models due to noise using Kramer’s activated escape mechanism.

**Robustness of features and models for text-dependent speaker verification**

Advisors: Abeer Alwan (Course project)

Investigated speaker-dependent features and classifiers such as SVM and GMM, for speaker verification under constraints of noisy environments and short utterances.

**Digit recognition under noisy and gender mismatch conditions**

Advisors: Abeer Alwan (Course project)

Developed algorithm to address mismatch conditions in an automatic speech recognition task using hidden markov models. Experience using HTK toolkit.
