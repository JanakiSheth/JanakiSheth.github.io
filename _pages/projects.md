### Classification of phonemes using neural recordings

Advisors: William Speier, Abeer Alwan

Preliminary analysis of multi-electrode LFP signals using machine learning to recognize differentiating neural channels for phoneme classification.

### Analysis of Kramer’s rule in auditory models

Advisors: Dolores Bozovic, Alex Levine (Manuscript in preperation)

Characterized homogenization of complex auditory models due to noise using Kramer’s activated escape mechanism.

### Robustness of features and models for text-dependent speaker verification

Advisors: Abeer Alwan (Course project)

Investigated speaker-dependent features and classifiers such as SVM and GMM, for speaker verification under constraints of noisy environments and short utterances.

### Digit recognition under noisy and gender mismatch conditions

Advisors: Abeer Alwan (Course project)

Developed algorithm to address mismatch conditions in an automatic speech recognition task using hidden markov models. Experience using HTK toolkit.
